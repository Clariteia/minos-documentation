# CQRS

Command-Query responsibility segregation is an architectural style that aims at separating how commands and queries are resolved within each microservice. A `command` is an operation that modifies the internal state of the service, although it does not return any value. On the other hand, a `query` computes and retrieves any data concerning business logic.
